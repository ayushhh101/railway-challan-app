## Tech Stack

**Frontend:** React + Vite, TailwindCSS, react-hot-toast, lucide-react  
**Backend:** Node.js, Express, Mongoose (MongoDB)  
**Other:** JWT Auth, Swagger (OpenAPI), Audit Logging, Seed script, C4 Architecture Diagrams  
**Planned / In‚Äëprogress:** Offline challan queue + later sync

## Features

### Core
1. Digital Challan Issuing (multi‚Äëstep wizard: passenger details ‚Üí offense ‚Üí fine/payment meta ‚Üí signature ‚Üí proof upload).
2. Offline Challan Drafting & Deferred Sync  
   - TTE can fill challan steps when connectivity is poor.  
   - Draft kept locally (localStorage / in‚Äëmemory) until network returns.  
   - Pending drafts are marked and can be retried (prevents data loss in the field).  
   - On successful sync, local draft is cleared and standard audit events are recorded.  
3. Challan Management: filter, search, view detail, verify.
4. Passenger Onboarding & separate passenger auth flow.
5. PDF generation & download for each challan.
6. Proof image upload (file middleware + stored in /uploads/proofs).
7. Role-based auth (Admin / TTE / Passenger) with protected routes.
8. Payment Integration (Test Mode) ‚Äì Razorpay dummy integration for challan fine payment simulation
9. Admin Analytics: monthly trends, heatmap, top TTEs, reason distribution, recovery stats.
10. Audit Logging & Anomaly Tracking (suspicious or outlier activity surfaced to admins).
11. Partial Profile Field Updates (per‚Äëfield save for TTE profiles).
12. Station seeding script for fast setup.
13. Validation layer (shared middleware) and structured error responses.
14. Reusable UI components (modals, charts, inputs, signature pad).
15. Swagger OpenAPI documentation (public URL).

## Payment System
- Test Mode: Integrated Razorpay payment gateway (dummy credentials) for challan payment flow
- Payment Tracking: Real-time status updates and payment verification
- Multiple Methods: Supports card, UPI, net banking simulation

### Why the Offline Capability Matters
- Demonstrates resilience: maintains workflow in low connectivity (common in transit environments).
- Improves data integrity: avoids losing issued challans mid‚Äëentry.
- Showcases forethought in UX + operational constraints.
